<h1>External Route Manager</h1>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Provides a facility for establishing a dedicated UDP route (which references a specified PID) through which external systems
(such as the RADD) can forward datagrams for multiplexing into DSS stream output.</p>

<h2>Design</h2>
<p>The external route manager has no external interface.  It receives route creation, update and deletion OSGi events by
registering with the {@link com.ccadllc.firebird.dss.server.realtime.snapshot.manager.RealTimeSnapshotManager}.  Once an
external route is created, a controller opens a port and listens for UDP datagrams.  When a datagram is received, it is
separated into Mpeg2 packets, routed by PID, assembled into data blocks and forwarded to the 
{@link com.ccadllc.firebird.server.realtime.stream.manager.StreamManager} to be sent to each destination for that stream.</p>

<p>The external route manager consists of the following components:</p>

<ul>
<li>{@link com.ccadllc.firebird.server.realtime.external.route.manager.ExternalRouteManager} handles the OSGi events from
the {@link com.ccadllc.firebird.dss.server.realtime.snapshot.manager.RealTimeSnapshotManager}, manages a
{@link com.ccadllc.firebird.server.realtime.external.route.manager.RouteController} for each route that is established, and
maintains a mapping of port to {@link com.ccadllc.firebird.server.realtime.external.route.manager.RouteController} so that
those routes can be updated and deleted.  When the class is initialized, it loads all 
{@link com.ccadllc.firebird.dss.server.common.RouteSnapshot} instances from the
{@link com.ccadllc.firebird.dss.server.realtime.snapshot.manager.RealTimeSnapshotManager} and sets up 
{@link com.ccadllc.firebird.server.realtime.external.route.manager.RouteController} instances for each UDP persisted route.</li>
<li>{@link com.ccadllc.firebird.server.realtime.external.route.manager.ExternalRouteManagerApplicationContextListener} listens
for when the Spring application context has been refreshed, such as when the bundle is started, or when the
{@link com.ccadllc.firebird.dss.server.realtime.snapshot.manager.RealTimeSnapshotManager} has been restarted.  It then tells the
{@link com.ccadllc.firebird.server.realtime.external.route.manager.ExternalRouteManager} to initialize itself.</li>
<li>{@link com.ccadllc.firebird.server.realtime.external.route.manager.RouteController} manages the UDP port through Apache Mina
and forwards acceptable Mpeg2 packets to the filter chain for the packet's PID so that the packet can be forwarded to the
appropriate stream.</li>
<li>{@link com.ccadllc.firebird.server.realtime.external.route.manager.RouteControllerHandler} is a specialization of the
{@link org.apache.mina.core.service.IoHandlerAdapter} callback for message reception.  When a datagram is received, it is split 
into Mpeg2 packets, and if the Mpeg2 packet header sync byte is valid and the adaptation field is unused, it is sent back to the 
{@link com.ccadllc.firebird.server.realtime.external.route.manager.RouteController} to be routed by PID.</li>
<li>{@link com.ccadllc.firebird.server.realtime.external.route.manager.PidChainController} manages the filter chain for a
specific PID, so that updates to the streams associated with a PID can be performed.</li>
<li>{@link com.ccadllc.firebird.server.realtime.external.route.manager.Mpeg2BlockTransformer} assembles data blocks from
Mpeg2 packets.</li>
<li>{@link com.ccadllc.firebird.server.realtime.external.route.manager.Inserter} forwards data blocks to the
{@link com.ccadllc.firebird.server.realtime.stream.manager.StreamManager} for each stream associated with a PID.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bundle Use</h2>
<p>{@link com.ccadllc.firebird.dss.server.realtime.external.route.manager} is exported with this bundle and is what the 
{@link com.ccadllc.firebird.dss.server.provisioning.facade.ProvisioningFacade} uses to get access to the route manager.</p>

<h2>JMX Support</h2>
<p>JMX instrumentation for routes are provided in this bundle for all routes, regardless of protocol or data type.  This 
instrumentation includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>port</li>
    <li>routeId</li>
    <li>pidMappings (if this is an Mpeg2 packet route)</li>
    <li>streamIds (if this is a block data route)</li>
    <li>properties (if this is a UDP route)</li>
</ul>
</p>Statistics about data handled by each route are also collected.  These statistics include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of Mpeg2 packets handled for PID to stream mappings (Mpeg2 packet data only)</li>
<li>Number of Mpeg2 packets rejected for not having a stream mapping for a PID (Mpeg2 packet data only)</li>
<li>Number of Mpeg2 packets handled for transformation to data blocks, by PID (Mpeg2 packet data only)</li>
<li>Number of Mpeg2 packets rejected while being transformed into data blocks, by PID (Mpeg2 packet data only)</li>
<li>Number of blocks handled (Block data only)</li>
</ul>
<p>JMX lookups are provided in this bundle for TCP routes (note - UDP route lookups are handled by 
{@link com.ccadllc.firebird.dss.server.realtime.snapshot.manager.impl.RealTimeSnapshotUdpRouteLookup}).  TCP lookups include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>{@com.ccadllc.firebird.dss.server.realtime.external.route.manager.management.TcpRouteLookup#getTcpRouteIdsForStreamId}</li>
    <li>{@com.ccadllc.firebird.dss.server.realtime.external.route.manager.management.TcpRouteLookup#getTcpRouteIdsForMappedPid}</li>
</ul>
<p>JMX Notifications are provided in this bundle for routes handling Mpeg2 packet data.  These notifications include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rejection of UDP datagram because it is not divisible by Mpeg2 packet size when it was previously not rejecting</li>
<li>Acceptance of UDP datagram because it is divisible by Mpeg2 packet size when it was previously rejecting</li>
<li>Rejection of Mpeg2 packet because adaptation field is in use when previous packet was not rejected</li>
<li>Acceptance of Mpeg2 packet because adaptation field is not in use when previous packet was rejected</li>
<li>Creation of stream mappings for a PID</li>
<li>Removal of stream mappings for a PID</li>
<li>Rejection of Mpeg2 packet because no stream mapping found for its PID, if previously was not rejecting for that PID</li>
<li>Rejection of Mpeg2 packet during block transformation when it was previously not rejecting</li>
<ul>
<li>Data block in spanned packet fills the entire packet, but the start bit is set</li>
<li>Packet start bit says block starts in this packet, but none was found</li>
<li>Pointer field offset value is invalid</li>
<li>Section length in data block is less than or equal to 0</li>
</ul>
<li>Acceptance of Mpeg2 packet during block transformation when it previousl packet was rejected</li>
</ul>
<p>To access this JMX data and operations, open a JMX console application (such as JConsole or VisualVM), select the application
runtime, navigate to the MBean view, and select the <code>DSS</code> namespace.  By selecting the operations tab, you will be able 
to invoke each of the operations by entering the appropriate parameter values and pressing the button for it.</p>
